### Hi, I'm Chris (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a security person in a software world. My focus is on bringing holistic and pragmatic security solutions to software companies ([bingo!](https://github.com/swagitda/infosec-buzzword-bingo)), and I'm especially partial to risk-reducing solutions which improve development processes or developer experience. Convenient, guardrail-centric security > inconvenient, tarpit-centric security.

Currently, I'm working on Cloud Security @ [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/our-company) as part of the Proactive Security department. My notable past roles include:
- Security Engineer, Vulnerability Management @ [Luta Security](https://www.lutasecurity.com/) on the [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) contract
- Product Security Engineer @ [Datto](https://datto.com), and Software Engineer before that

In my spare time, I am also a moderator of [r/cybersecurity](https://reddit.com/r/cybersecurity), the largest discussion-centric professional cybersecurity subreddit. I am also occasionally involved in private disclosures both solo and through my research company, [Machines Never Sleep, LLC](https://mns.llc/). If you'd like to chat or connect, you can find me on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/user/tweedge), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_tweedge), or elsewhere.
