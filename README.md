### Hi, I'm Chris (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a security person in a software world. My focus is on bringing holistic and pragmatic security solutions to software companies - a traditional failing of InfoSec due to intrinsic conflict between development organizations and security engineers. Red tape is my mortal enemy - ironically, policy can be a dear friend.

Currently, I'm working on Cloud Security @ Amazon as part of the Proactive Security department. My notable past roles include:
- Security Engineer, Vulnerability Management @ [Luta Security](https://www.lutasecurity.com/) on the [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) contract
- Product Security Engineer @ [Datto](https://datto.com), and Software Engineer before that

In my spare time, I am also involved in [Machines Never Sleep, LLC](https://mns.llc/), a cybersecurity research & development company I founded. You can usually find me coding, writing, yelling on r/hacking, and retweeting high quality SwiftOnSecurity cornposting.
