### Hi, I'm Chris (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a security person in a software world. My focus is on bringing holistic and pragmatic security solutions to software companies ([bingo!](https://github.com/swagitda/infosec-buzzword-bingo)). I believe this is a traditional failing of InfoSec due to conflict between development organizations and security engineers. However, I believe this conflict is not due to divergent goals, rather that it's due to broken forms of interaction and operation that haven't matured in ways that are compatible to the ways development has. For all its breakneck pace, security hasn't evolved to keep up.

Red tape is my mortal enemy - ironically, policy can be a dear friend.

Currently, I'm working on Cloud Security @ [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/our-company) as part of the Proactive Security department. My notable past roles include:
- Security Engineer, Vulnerability Management @ [Luta Security](https://www.lutasecurity.com/) on the [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) contract
- Product Security Engineer @ [Datto](https://datto.com), and Software Engineer before that

In my spare time, I am also involved in [Machines Never Sleep, LLC](https://mns.llc/), a cybersecurity research & development company I founded. You can usually find me writing code, yelling on the cesspool that r/hacking, and retweeting SwiftOnSecurity cornposts.
