### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I'm a security person in a software world. My focus is on bringing holistic and pragmatic security solutions to software companies, and I'm especially partial to risk-reducing solutions which improve development processes or developer experience ([bingo!](https://github.com/swagitda/infosec-buzzword-bingo)).

Currently, I'm a Cloud Security manager @ [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/our-company) as part of the Application Security organization, helming a multifaceted CloudSec function that focuses on promoting long-term sustainable architecture. My team is not the "run ScoutSuite and call it a day" type, thankfully. :)

My notable past roles include:
- Sr. Security Engineer, Amazon (completing an L4-through-L6 IC journey)
- Security Engineer, Vulnerability Management @ [Luta Security](https://www.lutasecurity.com/) on the [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) contract
- Product Security Engineer @ [Datto](https://datto.com), and Software Engineer before that

I do security research across many topic in my spare time (read: whatever grabs my interest, little real theme), and either dump half- to fully-baked repos on GitHub or [publish posts on my blog](https://chris.partridge.tech/). If you'd like to chat or connect, you can find my social media and ways to message me [on my contact page](https://chris.partridge.tech/contact/).
